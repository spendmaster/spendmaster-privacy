    <h2>Data Collection Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SpendMaster is designed with a <strong>local-first, privacy-focused architecture</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not operate backend servers that collect your budgeting or financial records.</li>
      <li>We do not require you to create an account to use core features.</li>
      <li>Your expenses, income, budgets, categories, and other finance records stay on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>

    <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>

    <h3>Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
      SpendMaster does <strong>not</strong> collect personal data such as your name, email, phone number, or your budgeting and
      financial records as part of the core app functionality. Any finance information you enter into the app is stored
      locally on your device and is not transmitted to us.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <p>
      We do not directly collect usage data ourselves. However, third-party SDKs used for advertising (and in some cases,
      measurement/analytics) may collect limited device and usage information independently, as described below.
    </p>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>AI-Powered Features and Third-Party AI Providers</h2>
    <p>
      SpendMaster offers optional AI-powered features that allow you to interact with a financial assistant.
    </p>

    <h3>How AI Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>AI features are optional and can be enabled/disabled in the app settings.</li>
      <li>You may configure your own third-party AI provider (for example, by entering an API key).</li>
      <li>If AI is unavailable or disabled, the app may provide responses using on-device intelligence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Handling for AI</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only the text you voluntarily submit in the AI chat may be sent to the AI provider you select.</li>
      <li>SpendMaster does not receive, store, log, or retain your AI conversations on our servers.</li>
      <li>AI requests are sent from your device to the chosen provider, and that provider processes the data under its own policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="small">
      We encourage you to review the privacy policy and terms of any AI provider you choose to use.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
      AI-generated responses are provided for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, tax,
      or legal advice. You are responsible for decisions you make based on information provided by the app or any AI feature.
    </p>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <hr class="hr" />

<h2>Email Communications and Support</h2>
<p>
  If You choose to contact Us via email (for example, to request support, report an issue,
  recover access, or submit a feature request), We may receive information You voluntarily
  provide, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your email address</li>
  <li>Your username</li>
  <li>The content of your message</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This information is received <strong>only through email communication</strong> and is
  <strong>not collected through the SpendMaster app itself</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  We use this information solely to respond to Your request and provide support.
  We do not store this information in the app, use it for advertising, analytics,
  or share it with third parties.
</p>

<p class="small">
  For security reasons, We recommend that users do not send sensitive information
  such as passwords via email.
</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      SpendMaster uses third-party advertising SDKs to support the app and fund development.
    </p>

    <h3>Advertising Providers</h3>
    <p>
      Ads may be served by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdMob</li>
      <li>Google Ads</li>
      <li>Unity Ads</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Collected by Advertising SDKs</h3>
    <p>
      These advertising providers may independently collect information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA where permitted and configured)</li>
      <li>Device identifiers and approximate location (derived from IP address)</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>App interaction and ad performance metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This information is collected directly by the advertising providers (not by SpendMaster) and is used to deliver ads,
      measure performance, and prevent fraud.
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      You can control personalized advertising preferences through your device settings (and where applicable, app consent prompts).
    </p>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>Use of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
      Because SpendMaster does not collect or store your budgeting/financial data on our servers, we primarily use data only
      in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the Service on your device.</li>
      <li>To respond to your support requests when you contact us (e.g., via email).</li>
      <li>To improve app stability and performance (including via third-party SDK reporting where applicable).</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>Sharing of Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      SpendMaster does not sell, rent, or share your personal financial records.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data may be shared only in the following limited situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>AI Providers (Optional):</strong> If you enable AI features, the text you submit may be shared with the AI provider
        you selected to generate responses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advertising SDKs:</strong> Advertising partners may collect device and usage information independently to serve and measure ads.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, court order, or valid governmental request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> For any other purpose with your explicit consent.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>Retention of Data</h2>
    <p>
      SpendMaster does not retain your budgeting or financial data because it is stored locally on your device.
      Third-party providers (such as AI providers and advertising networks) may retain data under their own retention policies.
    </p>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>Transfer of Data</h2>
    <p>
      SpendMaster does not transfer your locally stored budgeting or financial data to our servers.
      Third-party providers you choose to use (such as AI providers and ad networks) may process data in locations outside of your state
      or country under their own policies.
    </p>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>Delete Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      You can delete all locally stored app data at any time by deleting entries within the app, resetting the app data (if available),
      or uninstalling the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      For data handled by third-party AI providers or advertising providers, deletion and access requests must be directed to those providers.
    </p>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>

    <h3>Business Transactions</h3>
    <p>
      If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply.
      Since we do not store your budgeting or financial data on our servers, there is typically no user financial data to transfer.
    </p>

    <h3>Law Enforcement</h3>
    <p>
      Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests
      by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
    </p>

    <h3>Other Legal Requirements</h3>
    <p>
      The Company may disclose information in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
      <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>
      <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
      <li>Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public</li>
      <li>Protect against legal liability</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>Security of Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your information is important to us. SpendMaster stores your budgeting and financial data locally on your device.
      However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
      While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.
      If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us.
    </p>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed
      to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites or services.
    </p>

    <hr class="hr" />

      We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
